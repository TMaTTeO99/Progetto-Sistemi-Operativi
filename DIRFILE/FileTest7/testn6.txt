Your mother should know (…know.)
Lift up your hearts and sing me a song
That was a hit before your mother was born.
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (your mother should…)
Your mother should know (aaaah.)
Your mother should know (your mother should…)
Your mother should know (aaaah.)
