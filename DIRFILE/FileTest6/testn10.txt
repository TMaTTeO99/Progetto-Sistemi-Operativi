and he said i had just coming round the barn
bout time you grabbed my arm
when i heard momma holla
son hurry up
i was close enough from my own nose
to smell fresh cogger on the stove
and i saw daddy loadin’ up the truck
game polls on the tail gate
bobbers blowing in the wind
Since July of ’55
that’s as close as I’ve been…
