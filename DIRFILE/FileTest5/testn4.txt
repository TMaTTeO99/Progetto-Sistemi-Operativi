WHAT WOULD YOU THINK IF I SANG OUT OF TUNE
WOULD YOU STAND UP AND WALK OUT OF ME
LEND ME YOUR EARS AND I’LL SING YOU A SONG
AND I’LL TRY NOT TO SING OUT OF KEY

I GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS
I GET HIGH WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS
GOING TO TRY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS

WHAT DO I DO WHEN MY LOVE IS AWAY
DOES IT WORRY YOU TO BE ALONE
HOW DO I FEEL BY THE END OF THE DAY
