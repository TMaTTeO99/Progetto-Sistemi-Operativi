Well, I hope you come and see me in the movies.
Then I’ll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally.

We’ll make the scene about a man that’s sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bendin’ knee.
I’ll play the part and I won’t need rehearsing.
