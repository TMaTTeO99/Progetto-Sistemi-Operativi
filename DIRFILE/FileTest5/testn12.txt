They’re gonna put me in the movies.
They’re gonna make a big star out of me.
We’ll make a film about a man that’s sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally.

Well, I bet you I’m gonna be a big star.
Might win an Oscar. You can never tell.
The movie’s gonna make me a big star,
‘Cause I can play the part so well.
