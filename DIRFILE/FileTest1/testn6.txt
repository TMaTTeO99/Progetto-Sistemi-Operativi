I know what you've been through
I haven't been as true
as I need to be
I couldn't see it clear
and I let my fears get the best of me
I'm staring at the clouds and I can almost see the sun
I know its just a windfall away
but you could show me how to turn the tides around

I know I'll never make it on my own
I'm stumbling in and out of bars
but give me one more chance to come back homethis love we share is ancient as the stars.

I'm staring at the clouds and I can almost see the sun
I know its just a windfall away
but you could show me how to turn the tides around

I know I'll never make it on my own
all day long I'm crashing cars
but give me one more chance to come back home
this love we share is ancient as the stars.
