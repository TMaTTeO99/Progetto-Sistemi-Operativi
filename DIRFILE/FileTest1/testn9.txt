Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The word is out 
About the town 
To lift a glass 
Ahhh donâ€™t look down 

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song 
They practiced all year long 
Ding dong, ding dong 
Ding dong, ding dong 
Ding dong, ding dong
