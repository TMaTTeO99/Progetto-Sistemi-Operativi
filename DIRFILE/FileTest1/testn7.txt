In my dreams tonight
You were dancing to the tides
and the rhythm of the sea
under amber skies
diamonds in your eyes
and you were happy
and you were free
then I'm on the street
burning all my bridges
choking on the ashes
then I'm in my bed
tearing at the sheets

I know I'll never make it on my own
I can't go on the way things are
but give me one more chance to come back home
this love we share is ancient as the stars.
